# Water pollution

It is an issue that not only affects drinking water, but also affects the aquatic
ecosystem as well: plants, animals, and microorganisms to name a few. Approximately
70% of the world is covered in water, and underwater organisms has a large, indirect
impact on organisms living above ground such as disruption of the food chain
and destruction of some ecosystems.
