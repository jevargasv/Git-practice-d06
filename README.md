# Water pollution
Water pollution is an issue that plagues our oceans and other bodies of water.  
It is an issue that not only affects drinking water, but also affects the aquatic
ecosystem as well: plants, animals, and microorganisms to name a few. Approximately
70% of the world is covered in water, and underwater organisms has a large, indirect
impact on organisms living above ground such as disruption of the food chain
and destruction of some ecosystems.
